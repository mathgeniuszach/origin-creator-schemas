            The license your pack falls under. If left blank, defaults to "Unknown", which typically means "All Rights Reserved".
            I recommend setting this to CC BY 4.0, which means anyone can use your pack for any purpose and make changes as they desire, as long as they give you credit.
    license_text:
        type: string
        ext: true
        desc: |
            If you want to include a LICENSE file inside your mod, datapack, and resource pack, you can put it's content in this box.
            Leaving this blank will not include a LICENSE file in the pack.
