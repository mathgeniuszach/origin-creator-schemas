        type: boolean
        default: true
    replace:
        desc: If set to false, the data in this file will be appended to an already existing version of this layer. Useful to add custom origins to the default origin layer for example. If set to true, the layer will be replaced and only the origins specified in this file will appear.
        type: boolean
    loading_priority:
        desc: Specifies when this power is loaded. Higher numbers mean it's loaded later, which means it will override those with lower loading priorities which share the same ID.

        title: Random Unchoosable
        desc: Whether origins which are unchoosable (unchoosable field set to true in the origin file) should be included in the random option. Can for example be used to force players to choose a random origin, by setting this to true and making all origins in the layer unchoosable.

    exclude_random:
        desc: If specified, the origins included in this list will not be picked by the random choice.

    default_origin:
        desc: If set, the origin with this ID will automatically be chosen for a new player. If an orb of origin is used later on, the player will be able to choose another origin then and the default_origin will not apply. Could for example be used to make all players start as human, and then use the orb as a progression item to select an origin.
        type: string
        allow: '*a-z0-9_#\/:.-'
    auto_choose:
        desc: If set to true, this layer will automatically pick an origin for the player if only one option is available. This also applies when an orb of origin is used.
